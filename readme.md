# Reorganizer
A python script to reorder paper scans of old issues that were scanned in the wrong order.

## Directory Structure
The following is an example file structure:
```
data/
  1/
    1/
    2/
    3/
  2/
    1/
    2/
```
where the top level directory indicates the volume number and the inner level directory indicates the issue number

## Todo
 - [ ] clean up the code
 - [ ] add actual command line interface
 - [ ] pdf stitching
